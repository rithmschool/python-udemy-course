# API Project One

### Introduction

In this project, your goal will be to build off of the dad joke API introduced in this section. More specifically, you'll be writing a Python script that prompts someone for a word, then tells the person a random dad joke based on that word.

### Requirements

1. Create a file called `get_dad_joke.py` which, when run, prompts the user for a word.
2. When the user inputs a word, use the `icanhazdadjoke` API to search for jokes based on that word.
3. When you get the results back from the API...
    a. If there are no jokes found, tell the user there are no jokes. After this, the program is complete.
    b. If there is one joke, tell the user there's one joke, and print the text of the joke.
    c. If there is more than one joke, tell the user how many jokes matched the search word, and then print the text of one randomly selected joke from among the first set of results.

Good luck!
