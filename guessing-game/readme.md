# Guessing Game

In this mini project, you'll be given start code that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Then you'll write a loop that continues running until the user guesses the right number. You should let the user know if their guess is too high or too low.

As a bonus, when the user guesses the correct number, you can prompt the user to see if they want to continue playing, meaning a new random number should be generated and the loop starts over again.
